Friend Notes enhances the default Blizzard notes for friends. It will display the friend notes:

* In unit tooltips
* In the chat window when a friend logs on
* In /who results in the chat window

You can enable or disable the notes in those locations. You can also have the unit tooltips wrap to keep the tooltips narrow.
